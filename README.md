# RevatureGroup2_Project1

A Big Data Technology Project written in Scala that utilizes Spark SQL and Apache Hive to query and analyze 10,000 
e-commerce records from a generated CSV file. This project was developed primarily in IntelliJ utilizing a specific 
configuration that includes Scala 2.11.12, Spark 2.4.6 with Hadoop 2.6, and Apache Hive 2.3.9 with Java 1.8.1 operating
as the SDK. Sbt 0.13.18 functions as the simple build tool that handles Maven dependencies utilized in establishing a
SparkSession for all the required queries. Vegas-viz, which aims to be the missing MatPlotLib for Scala and Spark 
environments, provides a data visualization tool for outputting graphs and plots pertaining to each query.

This is the second project and first team collaboration for our Big Data batch here at Revature during weeks 7-9 
of training.

The members of this team include: Julio Ortiz, Michael Celusniak, Juan Sandoval, Raymond Fu, and Christiana Dickson.
